# Modeling, Optimization, and Simulation Labs (ISIS3302) - 202510

This repository contains the solutions to the lab assignments for the Modeling, Optimization, and Simulation course. Most of the labs were solved using the [Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/) library to model the different objective functions.

Throughout the labs, various topics are developed, including: mathematical modeling, numerical methods (Newton-Raphson and gradient descent), the simplex method, multi-objective optimization (Îµ-constraint method and weighted sum), and metaheuristics (genetic algorithms).
